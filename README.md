## Description

This webpage has two input fields, name and number. An output will be displayed below the input fields that will count up to the number you input starting at 0. Numbers with a 1 in it will be replaced with "Beep!", numbers with a 2 in it will be replaced by "Boop!", and numbers with a 3 in it will be replaced by "Won't you be my neighbor (the name you input)?". The replacement of 3s out rank that of the 2s and the replacement of 2s out rank that of the 1s (e.g. 32 or 13 will be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor (the name you input)?" and 21 will be replaced with "Boop!"). There is also an option to have the list starting with the number you input and counts down to 0 by clicking the "See Reversed" button.
